# AMD GPU Image Upscaler

**Transform your blurry, low-resolution images into stunning high-quality visuals with AI-powered upscaling!**

This tool is designed for **personal use**, perfect for enhancing photos, artwork, screenshots, or any images you want to bring back to life. While initial setup requires downloading AI models and dependencies, once configured, upscaling happens in the blink of an eye - typically **2-5 seconds per image** with GPU acceleration!

Built from scratch using Python and OpenCV with integrated AI models, this project combines cutting-edge deep learning techniques to deliver professional-grade results. Whether you're a photographer, digital artist, or just someone who loves crisp images, this upscaler bridges the gap between blurry originals and sharp, detailed masterpieces.

## Visual Comparisons

Based on testing with 7 carefully selected samples (including a "special" near-complete image), here are the results. Each comparison image is split 50/50: **Left side shows the original**, **right side shows the AI-upscaled version**.

### Sample 1-3: Standard Blurry Images
These intentionally degraded samples show how each method handles major quality restoration.

| Comparison | Image |
|------------|-------|
| **Sample 1 - Real-ESRGAN** | ![Sample 1 Real-ESRGAN](samples/realesrgan_1.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: Real-ESRGAN 4x upscaled* |
| **Sample 1 - EDSR** | ![Sample 1 EDSR](samples/edsr_1.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: EDSR 4x upscaled* |
| **Sample 2 - Real-ESRGAN** | ![Sample 2 Real-ESRGAN](samples/realesrgan_2.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: Real-ESRGAN 4x upscaled* |
| **Sample 2 - EDSR** | ![Sample 2 EDSR](samples/edsr_2.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: EDSR 4x upscaled* |
| **Sample 3 - Real-ESRGAN** | ![Sample 3 Real-ESRGAN](samples/realesrgan_3.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: Real-ESRGAN 4x upscaled* |
| **Sample 3 - EDSR** | ![Sample 3 EDSR](samples/edsr_3.png)<br>*Left: Original blurry image, Right: EDSR 4x upscaled* |

### Special Case: Near-Complete Image
| Comparison | Image |
|------------|-------|
| **Special - EDSR** | ![Special EDSR](samples/edsr_special.png)<br>*Left: Near-complete image, Right: EDSR refined*<br>*EDSR excels at gentle, precise enhancements* |

**Key Insights**:
- Real-ESRGAN provides **dramatic improvements** for blurry samples but can be "too powerful" for near-complete work
- EDSR offers **careful, precise sharpening** - better for tiny refinements and final polishing
- Both methods shine in different scenarios; choose based on your image's current quality level

### Real-ESRGAN (GPU-Accelerated GAN)
**Best for**: Major quality improvements, blurry/low-quality images, natural texture enhancement
- **Technology**: Generative Adversarial Networks trained on millions of images
- **Speed**: 2-5 seconds per image (GPU)
- **Strengths**: Dramatic detail recovery, natural textures, reduced artifacts, handles complex scenes exceptionally well
- **When to use**: When you need significant quality boosts, have time-sensitive work, or want the most natural-looking results
- **Note**: Can be "too powerful" for near-complete images, sometimes adding unwanted smudges or over-enhancement

### EDSR (CPU-Based CNN)
**Best for**: Precise sharpening, near-complete images, maintaining existing quality
- **Technology**: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow models
- **Speed**: 15-30 seconds per image (CPU)
- **Strengths**: Sharp edges, careful detail preservation, gentle enhancement, excellent for tiny refinements
- **When to use**: When working with already good images needing subtle improvements, or when GPU is unavailable
- **Note**: More conservative approach - better at "tiny add-ons" without overdoing it

### Performance Summary
- **Real-ESRGAN**: Faster (GPU), more dramatic improvements, better for severely degraded images
- **EDSR**: Slower (CPU), more precise, better for fine-tuning near-perfect images
- **Recommendation**: Start with Real-ESRGAN for most cases. Use EDSR for final polishing or CPU-only scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Setup Process

1. **Enable WSL and Install Ubuntu** (if not already done):
   ```
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
   This installs Ubuntu as your Linux distribution.

2. **Launch WSL Ubuntu** and update packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev -y
   pip3 install opencv-contrib-python numpy
   ```

4. **Download Real-ESRGAN Vulkan executable**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases
   - Download: `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan-[version]-windows.zip`
   - Extract to: `image_upscaler/realesrgan-windows/`
   - The Vulkan executable is hardware-accelerated for AMD GPUs

5. **EDSR Models** (downloaded automatically on first use):
   - Models are fetched from TensorFlow repositories
   - Stored locally in `models/` folder for future use
   - No manual download required - handled by the Python script

6. **Verify GPU drivers** (Windows side):
   - Ensure AMD Adrenalin drivers are up-to-date
   - Vulkan should be automatically enabled

**Total Setup Time**: 15-20 minutes (mostly downloading and installing dependencies)

**Post-Setup**: Run `image_upscaler.bat` - first run will download any remaining models automatically.

## Supported Formats

- **Input**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF
- **Output**: Same as input format with descriptive naming
- **Processing**: Automatic format detection and handling

## Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Python**: 3.7+
- **GPU**: AMD RX 6000+ with Vulkan (optional but recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: ~500MB for models + working space
