Our solution 242. Our solution is AI integrator setting bin. So how does this bin work? Well, the main thing is that we want the bin to be disabilisemently. The main way we do it is using AI system. We will have a camera inside the bin. So firstly, we would open the bin using the button. There will be a hash opens door. And inside will be fast-floor and the camera is camera can then be fident into an AI system to detect what kind of trash inside is given to them. And depending on when the is susceptible, it's not susceptible. It can spread into two different bins. If it's susceptible, it'll be totally left. If it's swethered to the right, if it's not susceptible, it'll be totally left. A small hash will open later to drop the bin to one side. And afterwards, some kind of incentive, like CDC voucher, can be given depending on some measures such as weight or frequency of recycling. So that's how it works. Why would this help solve the problem? So as mentioned before, there's a main problem with the current bin we have, the big blue bin. The one we mentioned are the most important are the spake. If you see, the big blue bin, it gives the owners to something to the user. So when the user are not super knowledgeable or don't care too much, they will either misuse it or not use it at all. Our bin soft-daced by shifting the member workload from the user to the AI. So this will make it much more wineless to today's trash easier to do it properly. And as for some confusion around recycling, the additional interface given to digital screen can also give Bob direct feedback to the user whether what's the example to help independent input more. The other issue that we mentioned is the large inlet of the bin. As mentioned before, it's linked to contamination because a large bin may be near the hawker's centre is very easy for people that are extremely too stout to do it. So since our bin have a mechanised hatch that needs to have been instant open by a button, these will prevent people from accidentally just using it anyhow. Moreover, since the hatch is closed shut, no and no weather conditions such water can ruin the sub-operate material inside the bin. Lastly, the lack of incentive is hard because digitalised means that some measures can be updated to the system. Our current idea is CCC for job, but since I can teach it all, the government can propose any other feature and they can be updated accordingly. So that's the idea of the bin and how it works. Now we can go to the cost and why this is possible to be implemented. So for the feasibility of our project, we have identified a rough estimate of the cost breakdown for different components that we will need. So it will cost around 500 dollars for one bin. And for funding, we have decided that any aid will be the one funding of our project because they have a specific grant for the co-funding of the second project called the 3R Fund. And you'll find out to 80% of quantifying costs subject to a cat of 1 million per project. And even if the government would have the money and the ability to fund the project of our scale. Can I have a time to enter to discuss the viability? So in terms of viability, we are making at the long term impact and we set this most from the public in terms of our solution. So initially we feel that the mobility of the bin attracts new users due to currency D and like the AI integrator into it. But after a while, firstly, the convenience, because you're planning to kind of replace the current blue bins, which are often located conveniently under the context, making a convenience for the users to use it work encouraging the users to continue using it. Secondly, that instant feedback allows the users to learn how to recycle currently. So there will be more incentivized to like continue using it, because they know that their efforts are not being like wasted and they're not unsure of what they are recycling. And last but not least, the incentives which are planning to give out enthusiasm are just based on the amount of recycled will help to motivate the users to continue using it and potentially become long-term recyclers. Thank you. So can you go to the slot with the one with the the treasure bin with camera inside it? Yeah, yeah. So as you can see, the placement is kind of like engineering thought, because I work with it and I work with it. And then I have to start with the one with the treasure bin with camera inside it. Yeah, yeah. So as you can see, the community is also being like a community. So I think it is engineering thought, because when people try to put bulky stuff inside, maybe like sharp trash or maybe like heavy trash, they might keep the camera and then the camera may get damage. So what kind of measures do you guys envision to prevent that happening? Also, I think your camera is about $55 or $50,000. It measures something other. Would you like to consider the question okay? An opportunity please? Actually, for the camera, we in terms of this, it's a bit big because you want it to make sure that it's visible in our slide. But we kind of wanted to be a bit more integrated within the bin's element itself. So it will be like opportunity. So it will prevent people from shooting it and then the other trash in your bin. So it will be a bit more integrated within the solution itself. So it won't be portrayed in your like this, but it will be within the plastic element of the bin. So firstly, people will be able to kind of steal it or take it away and also prevent people from shooting it and damaging it. Okay. I think also for the cause of the camera, it's like, it may be expensive, but I think you can get the government to help source for like cheaper other types of camera. So it won't be that expensive to maintain. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. So there's quite a nifty invention you have here, but I've not heard of this coming in other countries, but you've mentioned that other countries have better recycling rates. So like, for example, Japan, what do these other countries do that Singapore doesn't and why can the measures that they implement not be implemented here because this obviously has several costs associated with it. So why not take a page out of their book? Very good. Yeah. So, as you said, for example, in the japan, for example, it's a lot of the country that I've got a second place. I see the trust in. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, all the country here, there are several things that have multiple things going with them. Some of them have low deserts like island and super low deserts, but they are lower. So it's easier for them to enforce this kind of rule. Other country like Japan, they have a culture to, for this kind of take-out. The main thing that Singapore likes that we mentioned just now is the around the culture and information about recycling. It's not that it's impossible to recycle. It's just that a lot of Singapore don't bother to. It's not. Can some of the exercise to enforce this most strictly the whisper does in terms of finding and such? Yes. But since trash is such anonymous problem, you can't really know who to work at one time. The Singapore way, Singapore culture are just finding people for, for you saying it's less effective in this specific problem. So essentially the problem is that Singapore is. Okay. Okay. Our news specifically compared with Japan in this case. Because it's a bit hard to go through other countries. But for example, for Japan, another reason it's a bit hard to implement or to achieve the recycling is the ham is because Singapore actually deals with ways in a different way as to Japan. So for Japan, for example, even trash and ways has to be sorted out. So it actually encourages people to sort out recyclables also. Because even their trash has to be differentiated in the different categories. So it makes people more willing in a way to sort out the recyclables also. Because that's the way they deal with their trash. Because even ways they cannot just dispose it entirely. But in terms of Singapore, for example, majority of people live in HDB trash. So HDB is actually known to have a very convenient way of just dealing with trash where everybody can bundle up everything that they want to show away and get rid of it easily. So it makes people less inclined and less willing to recycle. So I think that's another reason why our rates are so low as compared to another country, like, for example, Japan. So I think that's why you also need certain incentives to ask people to go to extra mile to partying recycling. And it's like follow up to that. If the root cause is the way that we've been doing, why do we need a engineering solution when you can have a cheaper policy solution which we know is proven to work in the case of Japan and just change the way that trash is thrown away. So as I said before, it's mainly a culture thing. Singapore is not as super individualistic corporate business. But it's not just a natural business. It's not just a business. It's not just a natural individualistic corporate to America, etc. We are still quite much more country like completely a lot country. So there's a lot of industry with kind of policy. The reason why Japan policy was so far because it's implemented for a long time already. So people are used to it. So they don't feel burdened by it. Singapore, since if you want to implement this, it will be a very new thing. Like you have to try to implement the 5 cents classic back thing. People combat a whole lot. And that's just a very small inconvenience. If you can imagine if you ask people to sort that trash, they will combat a whole lot about the government of like, oh, they cannot. Why you ask to do this? Or, why is it not your bichy to solve? So I am not cultural, different socialized. Why you can't implement the way you do things in like, for example, which I have learned because of land constraint and so we saw the question. So as I mentioned, let's say, in Japan, they saw that they always in the different categories because they are able to have different fact sheets and facilities to deal with the different ways differently. But, for Singapore, we actually don't have the lenses. So that's why we end up having to bundle all our ways and throw it. And, in theory, they did to go to the Samagawa landfill. And so it will be hard to ask the people in Singapore to solve their ways in different categories and do the same for its cycle rules. Because the ways itself, in the end, for Singapore, for example, are just to be bundled together and like, go to the landfill in the day. So the policy is a bit hard to implement. It's a land constraint and facility and they have here. Okay. I think you mentioned among the slides that the AI system will be free. How will we make it free? Because it's so like for the AI system, I think you have our own internal group of people, like software engineers like design the system. So it's like, they are free in a sense that we do it to source it from outside people. So it's we did our own company. Yeah. Okay. So I think we would have to request like, assistance from the government. We would have to request assistance from the government to design the AI system. So it will be free. Yeah. Yeah. So I think we would have to request. Yeah. So I think I love this course here for single-time course. AI system as well. Development time is not free. It is technically still not a capital course. It's an R&D course which quite hard to sound in. Since we want our air model to be local offline. It actually doesn't any incur any ongoing course in that way. So that's why we just assume it's free. Very wishes to work for. So you mentioned that the button will prevent the use of your bin, right? But let's say you just open the address button, you open the bin. And just put a time-stop installation. But maybe 10 items will be something to address that. Yeah. Okay. Any of you can answer that. So the good and bad thing about having a device in this deck, you can have a lot of telemetry on it. So this kind of thing where it is offer stuff, the bad thing is that obviously digital system is more vulnerable to this kind of error, like the catch word close properly, the lot of things, what the world jam. But since digitalized, it also means that we can alert the proper not-at-talker thing more, like the cost of the year easier is often just like wandering around to report. The big-head just report is soft, or I'm offer stuff, I'm full, I have this problem, that problem. Obviously, if you want to be more heavy-handed on it, you can process it a bit around it and note the system block from the bin and pack it to the CCTV to see who offer stuff there. And go from there to that is quite of heavy-handed address. Nice thing about the digital system is that you can have a lot of impromptu solutions, you can add on later for your software updates. Software updates. Okay. Alright, I think that's a wrap. Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks.
